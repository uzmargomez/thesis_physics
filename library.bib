abstract = {We solve the coupled Einstein-Vlasov system in spherical symmetry using direct numerical integration of the Vlasov equation in phase space. Focusing on the case of massless particles we study critical phenomena in the model, finding strong evidence for generic type I behaviour at the black hole threshold that parallels what has previously been observed in the massive sector. For differing families of initial data we find distinct critical solutions, so there is no universality of the critical configuration itself. However we find indications of at least a weak universality in the lifetime scaling exponent, which is yet to be understood. Additionally, we clarify the role that angular momentum plays in the critical behaviour in the massless case.},

abstract = {The main purpose of this article is to guide the reader to theorems on global properties of solutions to the Einstein-Vlasov system. This system couples Einstein's equations to a kinetic matter model. Kinetic theory has been an important field of research during several decades where the main focus has been on nonrelativistic- and special relativistic physics, e.g. to model the dynamics of neutral gases, plasmas and Newtonian self-gravitating systems. In 1990 Rendall and Rein initiated a mathematical study of the Einstein-Vlasov system. Since then many theorems on global properties of solutions to this system have been established. The Vlasov equation describes matter phenomenologically and it should be stressed that most of the theorems presented in this article are not presently known for other such matter models (e.g. fluid models). The first part of this paper gives an introduction to kinetic theory in non-curved spacetimes and then the Einstein-Vlasov system is introduced. We believe that a good understanding of kinetic theory in non-curved spacetimes is fundamental in order to get a good comprehension of kinetic theory in general relativity.},

@article{biswasphysical,
abstract = {Since its first introduction, the Schwarzschild metric has been written in various coordinate systems. This has been done primarily to understand the nature of the coordinate singularity at the event horizon. However, very often, the mathematics of a coordinate system does not provide a clear physical interpretation. In Schwarzschild's original work, the origin of the radial coordinate was at the event horizon. Hence, there was no black hole. The generally accepted current definition of the radial coordinate has an origin beyond the horizon. This necessitates the discussion of black holes. Here, some well-known and some not-so-well-known coordinate systems will be visited in search of a physical interpretation. It will be noted that they all agree at large radial distances. However, the location of the origin of the radial coordinate can be different for different systems. Some "natural" coordinate systems can exclude the entirety of the interior of a black hole from the physical manifold. Such coordinate systems maybe physically more acceptable as they avoid the issue of the metric signature change across the horizon. Mathematically, the metric signature alone can distinguish time from space coordinates. Hence, coordinate systems that include the interior of the black hole need to switch the physical meanings of time and one of the space coordinates.},

The tensor virial theorem is analyzed, and the development of higher-order virial equations is reviewed; the special and general relativistic versions of the virial theorem are developed separately. Complications due to magnetic fields, internal energy, and rotation are investigated, and results of applying the variational approach to the virial theorem are studied. An explicit form is obtained for the simple scalar theorem applicable to self-gravitating systems, the pulsational formula originally due to Ledoux is recovered, and the variational approach is expanded to include effects of magnetic fields and rotation. Some applications of the virial theorem to problems involving the pulsational stability of white dwarfs, effects of rotation and magnetic fields on the white-dwarf gravitational instability, and the stability of neutron stars are examined.},

In the past, the leading particle candidates were cold and collisionless, and typically predicted missing energy signals at particle colliders. However, recent progress has greatly expanded the list of well-motivated candidates and the possible signatures of dark matter. This review begins with a brief summary of the standard model of particle physics and its outstanding problems. We then discuss several dark matter candidates motivated by these problems, including WIMPs, superWIMPs, light gravitinos, hidden dark matter, sterile neutrinos, and axions. For each of these, we critically examine the particle physics motivations and present their expected production mechanisms, basic properties, and implications for direct and indirect detection, particle colliders, and astrophysical observations. Upcoming experiments will discover or exclude many of these candidates, and progress may open up an era of unprecedented synergy between studies of the largest and smallest observable length scales.},

@book{Hartle,
abstract = {The aim of this groundbreaking new book is to bring general relativity into the undergraduate curriculum and make this fundamental theory accessible to all physics majors. Using a "physics first" approach to the subject, renowned relativist James B. Hartle provides a fluent and accessible introduction that uses a minimum of new mathematics and is illustrated with a wealth of exciting applications. The emphasis is on the exciting phenomena of gravitational physics and the growing connection between theory and observation. The Global Positioning System, black holes, X-ray sources, pulsars, quasars, gravitational waves, the Big Bang, and the large scale structure of the universe are used to illustrate the widespread role of how general relativity describes a wealth of everyday and exotic phenomena.},

abstract = {We consider the motion of classical spinning test particles in Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics and investigate innermost stable circular orbits (ISCO). The main goal of this work is to find analytically the small-spin corrections for the parameters of ISCO (radius, total angular momentum, energy, orbital angular frequency) of spinning test particles in the case of vectors of black hole spin, particle spin and orbital angular momentum being collinear to each other. We analytically derive the small-spin linear corrections for arbitrary Kerr parameter {\$}a{\$}. The cases of Schwarzschild, slowly rotating and extreme Kerr black hole are considered in details. For a slowly rotating black hole the ISCO parameters are obtained up to quadratic in {\$}a{\$} and particle's spin {\$}s{\$} terms. From the formulae obtained it is seen that the spin-orbital coupling has attractive character when spin and angular momentum are parallel and repulsive when they are antiparallel. For the case of the extreme Kerr black hole with co-rotating particle we succeed to find the exact analytical solution for the limiting ISCO parameters for arbitrary spin. It has been shown that the limiting values of ISCO radius and frequency do not depend on the particle's spin while values of energy and total angular momentum depend on it. We have also considered circular orbits of arbitrary radius and have found small-spin linear corrections for the total angular momentum and energy at given radius. System of equations for numerical calculation of ISCO parameters for arbitrary {\$}a{\$} and {\$}s{\$} is also explicitly written.},

Such solutions have a curvature singularity by construction, and their initial data on a Cauchy surface to the past of the singularity can be chosen to have compact support in momentum space. They can also be truncated at large radius so that they have compact support in space, while retaining self-similarity in a central region that includes the singularity. However, the Vlasov distribution function cannot be bounded. As a simpler illustration of our techniques and notation we also construct the general spherically symmetric and static solution, for both massive and massless particles.},

To start with some general facts are collected and a local existence theorem for the Cauchy problem stated. Next the case of spherically symmetric asymptotically flat solutions is examined in detail. The approach taken, using maximal-isotropic coordinates, is new. It is shown that if a singularity occurs in the time evolution of spherically symmetric initial data, the first singularity (as measured by a maximal time coordinate) occurs at the centre. Then it is shown that for small initial data the solution exists globally in time and is geodesically complete. Finally, the proof of the general local existence theorem is sketched. This is intended to be an informal introduction to some of the ideas which are important in proving such theorems rather than a formal proof.},

The present translation is aimed at a wide audience, including (but not limited to) advanced undergraduate and graduate students in mathematics, as well as physicists interested in the diverse applications of differential geometry to physics. In addition to a thorough treatment of the fundamentals of manifold theory, exterior algebra, the exterior calculus, connections on fiber bundles, Riemannian geometry, Lie groups and moving frames, and complex manifolds (with a succinct introduction to the theory of Chern classes), and an appendix on the relationship between differential geometry and theoretical physics, this book includes a new chapter on Finsler geometry and a new appendix on the history and recent developments of differential geometry, the latter prepared specially for this edition by Professor Chern to bring the text into perspectives.},

"Today a dilemma confronts any one intent on$\backslash$npenetrating the mysteries of differential geometry. On the one hand one$\backslash$ncan consult numerous classical treatments of the subject in an attempt to$\backslash$nform some idea of how the concepts within it developed."$\backslash$n"Unfortunately a modern mathematical education tends to make$\backslash$nclassical mathematical works unaccessible, particularly those in differential$\backslash$ngeometry.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nChapter 1 is a discussion of topological manifolds. It is mainly a survey$\backslash$nof the standard examples Sn, Tn, Pn etc. It contains a section I particularly$\backslash$nliked on the various ways of immersing projective 2-space in R3, e.g.$\backslash$nattaching a disk to a Moebius band, cross caps, the image of a monoidal$\backslash$ntransformation, etc.$\backslash$nChapter 2 defines differentiate manifolds and talks about immersions.$\backslash$nChapter 3 is a formidable chapter (which I disliked), on the tangent$\backslash$nbundle. All the various definitions of a tangent bundle are given: via$\backslash$nderivations of functions, via equivalence classes of curves, via charts etc. ;$\backslash$nand it is shown that any functor from manifolds to vector bundles which$\backslash$nassigns df to Rn is the tangent bundle. The proof is quite long and involves$\backslash$ntwo hideous commutative diagrams. Well, okay.$\backslash$nChapter 4 is on tensors. (There is a helpful discussion of the classical$\backslash$nversus the modern point of view on pp. 7-8 and also a discussion of how$\backslash$nthe perverse terminology "covariant" and "contravariant" came to be.)$\backslash$nChapters 5 and 6 are on vector fields and foliations, respectively.$\backslash$nChapter 5 begins by reviewing some of the problems that can occur when$\backslash$none tries to integrate a differential equation (on R1 say). My tendency,$\backslash$nwhen I teach this, a deplorable one, is to sweep all these problems under$\backslash$nthe carpet. Then the Picard existence theorem is proved, and the one$\backslash$nparameter group constructed. The Lie derivative L{\textless}* (of a form, tensor,$\backslash$nvector field) is defined, and it is carefully shown that L{\^{}}rj = [{\{}$\backslash$pounds{\}}, rj]. There is$\backslash$nan excellent discussion at the end of the section, much clearer than I have$\backslash$nseen in any other standard text, of the parallelogram law for computing.},

We show that the phase-space volume element is a Lorentz constant and construct the general particle distribution function from first principles. Application to thermal equilibrium lets us derive a modified version of the isotropic relativistic thermal distribution, the modified J$\backslash$"uttner distribution corrected for the Lorentz-invariant phase-space volume element. Finally, we discuss the relativistic modification of a number of plasma parameters.

abstract = {Software Testing is one of the important activities in software development process. Depending on the testing method employed, software testing can be implemented at any time in the development process. Traditionally most of the test effort occurs after the requirements have been defined and the coding process has been completed, but in the agile approaches most of the test effort is on-going. Conventional testing requires expensive dedicated infrastructure and resources that are only used sporadically. The growing complexity of business applications, it is harder to build and maintain in-house testing facilities that mimic real-time environments. Cloud computing has opened up new opportunities for software testing, which provides unlimited resources with scalability, flexibility and availability of distributed testing environment. It reduces the execution time of testing of large applications and lead to cost-effective solutions. However, it also explores challenges such as data security and a lack of standards. In this paper we present a comparative study on conventional software testing with cloud testing. We also highlight the challenges of these testing paradigms.},
